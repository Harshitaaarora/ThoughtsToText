# üß† Thought-to-Text Converter (EEG-Based)  

An innovative project that leverages **EEG signals**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)**, and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to create a *thought-to-text conversion system*. This system is designed to empower individuals with motor disabilities or communication challenges by translating their brain activity into text for seamless interaction with smart devices and communication.  


## üåü Features  
- **EEG Signal Processing**: Preprocessing and analysis of EEG data.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Advanced models for recognizing patterns in brainwave data.  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: For feature extraction and improving the accuracy of thought-to-text translation.
- **Long SHort Term Memory (LSTM)**: For temporal feature extraction.
- **Customizable Framework**: Flexible design for adapting to different use cases and datasets.  
- **User-Centric Application**: Aimed at assisting individuals with limited mobility or communication barriers.  


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
- **Programming Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries & Tools**:  
  - NumPy, Pandas (Data manipulation)  
  - SciPy (Signal processing)  
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch (Deep learning models)  
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data visualization)  


## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works  
1. **Data Collection**:  
   - Collect EEG signals using an EEG headset or simulator. (Here we are using the gathered dataset of KaraOne)  
2. **Preprocessing**:  
   - Apply filtering and normalization to remove noise from EEG data.  
3. **Feature Extraction**:  
   - Use CNNs and LSTMs to identify meaningful patterns in the signals.  
4. **Model Training**:  
   - Train ML models to associate EEG patterns with specific thoughts or text outputs.  
5. **Prediction**:  
   - Generate textual output based on real-time EEG data.  


## üìä Datasets  
- 5 syllables(ba, ku, mi, na, ne) dataset by KaraOne.  
- Ensure to preprocess and format the data.  


## üí° Future Enhancements  
- Real-time EEG signal analysis.  
- Integration with smart devices for live communication.  
- Multilingual support for diverse text outputs.  
- Improved accuracy through ensemble learning models.
